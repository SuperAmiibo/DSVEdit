Memory used for entities in OoE is 021092A0 - 0211DF5F. Each entity is 0x160 bytes long. They range from 0-F1.

000,4: Pointer to update code.
004,4: Pointer to draw code.
008,4: Pointer to destroy code?
00D,1: State of the entity. Each entity's update code handles this differently.
010,2:
012,2: Globally unique ID for this entity.
01A,2: Frame counter.
021,1: Opacity.
024,4: X pos on the screen.
028,4: Y pos on the screen.
02C,4: Z position.
030,4: X pos.
034,4: Y pos.
038,4: Z pos.
03C,4: X velocity.
040,4: Y velocity.
044,4: Movement speed.
  This is the absolute speed value this entity should move at, without taking direction into account.
  Currently only Skull Spider is known to use this.
048,4: X friction.
04C,4: Y acceleration (gravity).
064,2: Rotation.
  Every 0x4000 is equivalent to 90 degrees.
06C,2: Sprite info index.
  This is an index in the currently loaded sprite info list, 0211E0C0.
074,4: Bitfield related to sprite drawing.
  0004 Enable rotation.
  0020 Ignore part palette indexes. Always used palette 0 for every part.
    Note that things that affect the entire entity's palette are not affected by this, like the entity's palette offset. Only the palette specified by each sprite part is ignored.
    (This is used by the slash trails of melee weapons.)
  0040 Ignore part GFX page indexes?
  0080 Direction. Set if facing left, clear if facing right.
  0200 Pulsating effect, used by Invisible Man.
  0400 If set, the entity's opacity value will only be used when drawing parts that have a nonzero palette index.
    (This is used by the slash trails of melee weapons.)
  8000 Invisible, do not draw.
078,4: Pointer to sprite animation list.
07C,2: Current animation index.
07E,2: Current keyframe index in this animation.
080,2: Bitfield of sprite animation properties.
  01 - Animation finished. This is set automatically by SpriteAnimate when an animation finishes its first loop.
  02 - Do not loop animation
  04 - Play animation in reverse
  08 - Do not animate, just freeze on whatever the current keyframe is
082,2: Delay in frames remaining before advancing to the next animation keyframe.
084,2: Current sprite frame index.

0A0,2: Sprite x offset relative to the entity's position.
0A2,2: Sprite y offset relative to the entity's position.
0A4,1: Controls the iframes this entity should give.
  This is an index in list 020B5C28 - a list of different iframes values. Each entry is 1 byte long.
  This value is only read when the entity is initialized, changing it after the entity already exists has no effect.
0A6,1: Hitbox bitfield.
